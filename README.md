## About

Outbreak Mod created by Alex (TheAmazingAussie) inspired by DayZ mod created for Arma 3, is a multiplayer survival mod that aims for realism in world where infection has taken over and turned people into monsters.

The master repository is the stable branch, if you want to test the newest updates then go to [here](https://github.com/OutbreakMod/Outbreak/tree/unstable) however **I cannot guarantee** that you won't experience problems with client performance and you will *most likely* experience error warnings and bugs.

Server data located here: https://github.com/OutbreakMod/OutbreakServer

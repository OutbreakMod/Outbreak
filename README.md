Outbreak Mod
--------------------------

Outbreak Mod created by Alex (TheAmazingAussie), inspired by DayZ mod created for Arma 3.

The master repository is the stable branch, if you want to test the newest updates then go to [here](https://github.com/OutbreakMod/Outbreak/tree/unstable) however I cannot gurantee that you won't experience problems with client performance and you will most likely experience error warnings and bugs.

Server data located here: https://github.com/OutbreakMod/OutbreakServer

Features

- All data is saved through the server which utilises MySQL and ArmaHive.
- Permadeath system (lose all your gear when dying, respawn starts a fresh character)
- Clothes are randomised when respawning
- Loot spawning in different buildings, different types of loot depending on which buildings
- The mod is very optimised to deliver performance found in single-player Arma 3.
